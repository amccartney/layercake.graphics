Layer Cake example
===

This is a starter example for using [Layer Cake](https://layercake.graphics).

## Viewing

```sh
npm install
npm run build && npm start
```

Your app will be running at [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000).

## Developing

```sh
npm run dev
```

Your app will be running at [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Server-side rendering

```sh
npm run pre-render
```

This uses Rollup to create `build/App.js` and then renders that JavaScript into HTMl and CSS files in the `pre-rendered/` directory.

To view it, run:

```sh
npm run serve
```

Your app will be running at [localhost:3000](http://localhost:5000).
